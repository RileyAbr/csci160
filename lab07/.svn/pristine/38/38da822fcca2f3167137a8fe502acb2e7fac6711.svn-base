    /*  For this portion of the assignment, you will be creating a simple animation 
        of a ball that moves around the screen of an applet and bounces off of the
        walls.
    
        As part of this assignment, you will need to have first completed the Ball class. 
    
        1) Create an instance of the Ball class and make sure it can draw itself
        2) Complete the detectCollisions method that determines when your Ball object
            has collided with any of the walls, in which case it should reverse direction.
        3) Create an instance of the Timer class and assign it an ActionListener that
            moves the ball around and repaints the screen every time it triggers its event
